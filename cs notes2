DPIA

Getting a DPIA is a recurring and seemingly intractable problem.

There are myriad web platforms for almost all areas of CS curriculum ready to use, many following pedagogies which are research backed and up to date.

The issue about DPIA means that teachers and learners in CS are missing out.

The work of preparing DPIA for any given site is replicated across every LA that wants to use it. Yet drawing up a DPIA seems to be such a headache for the LA in terms of time that the easiest route is to say "no".

It would seem no-one in a position to do something about the problem is willing to do so. Frustrating beyond words.

Is ES in a position to raise the issue or to champion a solution or if not help CS teachers find some authority who will?
